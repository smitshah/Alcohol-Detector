I have attached the KiCAD Schematic of my project. In my actual project I have done it with Arduino, but initially I have started the project with 8051, but I was not able to complete that due to lack of Development Board of 8051.

I have also added 8051 file if any one want to do it using 8051. The name of the file is proj.asm

The Gerber files of PCB are in pdf format, but you can also save it in .gbr format by opening the project.
