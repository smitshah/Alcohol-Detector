# Alcohol-Detector

**INTRODUCTION**

For effective detection of Alcohol Concentration, we are using MQ3 Gas Sensor, which is cheap and portable. Our product will sense the amount of alcohol consumed by the person and it will display the same to the LCD. This product can be used for identifying whether the person is drunk, which is used by traffic police across many countries .If the person inside car has consumed alcohol then it is detected by the sensor. The sensed value is displayed on the 16x2 LCD Display. 

The MQ3 Alcohol sensor detects the alcohol consumption by the smell of the breath. The sensor is an analog as well as a digital sensor which on its analog pin outputs the analog voltage proportional to the alcohol level. 
For different countries, the level of alcohol in the blood that defines a person as over the limit for driving varies. The range ranges from 0.01 to 0.10. 

Most countries have a limit of about 0.05. 

For example, Greece, Greenland, and Iceland all have limits of 0.05. Canada has a higher limit set at 0.08. 

In the United States, it is also 0.08. 

In India, the permissible blood alcohol content (BAC) is set at 0.03% per 100ml blood.

**Application of the project**

* Used in cars for engine locking.
* Used as a alcohol detector machine.


**Conclusion**

We have made an Alcohol Detector, which will detect alcohol and give alert when alcohol level in mixture of carbon dioxide and methanol is more 400. By using this, product in cars i.e. by installing this near steering and using this as engine locking system we can reduce the rate of accidents that take place due to drink and drive.
